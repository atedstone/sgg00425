    "Freshly cloned from https://git.unepgrid.ch/bruno.chatenoux/datacube-notebooks, you should have 3 folders and this README file:\n",
    "1. __utils__ folder contains the default packages from ODC available in https://github.com/opendatacube/datacube-notebooks/tree/master/utils with a few modifications (e.g. deprecated 'import gdal')\n",
    "1. __swiss_utils__ folder contains the packages created within the frame of Swiss Data Cube project\n",
    "1. __examples__ folder contains demo notebooks to teach new users how to interact with ODC data, as well as demo notebooks 'demo_FUN_*' presenting the functionnalities from swiss_utils package:\n",
    "    - *[THE_Demo.ipynb](./examples/THE_Demo.ipynb)*: general demo notebook to help user new to ODC and Jupyter, to start interracting with dataset through Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "    - *[config_tool.ipynb](./examples/config_tool.ipynb)*: this notebook is intended to help new user or confirmed user facing an unknown ODC, to create a configuration cell (product, platform, geographical extent, time period, measurements (bands))\n",
    "    - *demo_FUN_*.ipynb*: demo notebook of a function developped in the context of the [Swiss Data Cube](https://www.swissdatacube.org) (SDC)\n",
    "    - *demo_PROD_*.ipynb*: demo notebook of a specific product.\n",

    "As a single DC algorithm quite easily monopolize all harware resources, the `monit_sys` function allows a user to monitor briefly CPU and memory (RAM) activity. Then the user can define the level or available resources before to run its own script.\n",

    "There is no way (at the time of writing this script) to re-open an updated version of a closed Jupyter script. Which does not allow the user to evaluate the progression of the running workflow once the dedicated page closed. The `printandlog` function, try to solve this issue, by printing and logging specific messages at the same time. Then even if the printed information is not anymore available, the user has access anytime to the updated log.\n",

If `resample` option is activated ('up' or 'down_mean', 'down_median') up/downsampling is performed and products output combined into a single 'lss2' prefix. `dropna` option removes time without any data. This function works as [demo_FUN_load_multi_clean](./examples/demo_FUN_load_multi_clean.ipynb) function, but with a mix of Landsat and Sentinel 2 products.\n",
